# Secure Programming Minor
README.md file containing some basic information about the project.

## Branches
Every feature / milestone will have a branch. With this we can program on a feature, if a member gets sick we can continue working on it.
This also adds the benefit of making merges and stuff much more beneficial.

To do this successfully first the archetecture with all classes has to be established in the Main branch. After this the per-feature branches can be made, this prevents merge conflicts and adds the ability to just fill in the desired class.
